# Xylophone App

Hey folks! I started learning Swift. I can say it went well so far. I tried making an app from Angela Yu's course myself from scratch. 
There are some problems in the UI part. It's just a clear view for iPhone 11 but I'll figure it out. The logic of the application is simple. 
The xylophone we know.
